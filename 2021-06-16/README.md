# Golang Review

## 2021_06_16 Meeting

* Follow-up on the refactoring exercise from last week:
  * Check out the `exercises.md` file in this folder. I've got my example refactor there. I'll see if Luke will post his, too.
  * The 2nd follow-up on this io-package theme is exercise #2 at the bottom of that same `exercises.md` file.

* The Ch. 11 "self quiz":
  * Check out the `quiz_from_randy.md` file in this folder.
  
    (A couple of these are same/similar to ones you guys shared during the meeting. I guess great minds think alike. :) )

* Additional Ch. 11 quizzes:
  * If you'd like to share the quiz you created, please do. Ping me with your Github handle. I'll invite you as a "collaborator" on this repo, and you can push up a copy of your quiz. I suggest naming your quiz file something like "quiz_from_myname.md" or "quiz_from_myname.doc". Folks can check it out and try working your quiz.

* Closing example to think about for next week (when we'll be looking at Ch. 12 and maybe Ch. 13):
  * How is the timer (and/or its typical use case) that you would create with an automatically timed-out `context.Context` different from a timer you would create from the `time.After` function?
